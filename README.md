# Local Weather

A local weather app I have created while going through the intermediate front end development projects at https://freeCodeCamp.com.

<em>Completed June 7, 2017</em>

The second intermediate front end development project I completed while completing lessons on freeCodeCamp. For this project I retrieved the information displayed from the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast). I made the site request for the user's current location to retrieve the current geolocation coordinates and retrieve the relevant local weather with those coordinates using the API. I used the built in CSS flexbox for this app instead of BootStrap to try out something new (see my flexbox notes in the project files). A button to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit is also included.
